   tried to say "No such path 'missing' in HEAD".
   (merge a46442f jk/blame-commit-label later to maint).

 * "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
   not correctly signal errors when it attempted to update the working
   tree files but failed for whatever reason.
   (merge 89ea903 jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure later to maint).

 * Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce
   broken patches.
   (merge 339de50 dk/format-patch-ignore-diff-submodule later to maint).

 * After attempting and failing a password-less authentication (e.g.,
   Kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password-based Basic
   authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.
   (merge 4dbe664 bc/http-fallback-to-password-after-krb-fails later to maint).

 * The "git push" documentation for the "--repo=<there>" option was
   easily misunderstood.
   (merge 57b92a7 mg/push-repo-option-doc later to maint).

 * Code to read a branch name from various files in the .git/
   directory would have overrun array limits if asked to read an empty
   file.
   (merge 66ec904 jk/status-read-branch-name-fix later to maint).

 * Remove a superfluous conditional that is always true.
   (merge 94ee8e2 jk/remote-curl-an-array-in-struct-cannot-be-null later to maint).

 * The "git diff --raw" documentation incorrectly implied that C(opy)
   and R(ename) are the only statuses that can be followed by a score
   number.
   (merge ac1c2d9 jc/diff-format-doc later to maint).

 * A broken pack .idx file in the receiving repository prevented the
   dumb http transport from fetching a good copy of it from the other
   side.
   (merge 8b9c2dd jk/dumb-http-idx-fetch-fix later to maint).

 * The error message from "git commit", when a non-existing author
   name was given as value to the "--author=" parameter, has been
   reworded to avoid misunderstanding.
   (merge 1044b1f mg/commit-author-no-match-malformed-message later to maint).

 * "git log --help" used to show rev-list options that are irrelevant
   to the "log" command.
   (merge 3cab02d jc/doc-log-rev-list-options later to maint).

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" used to under-allocate memory when the
   fix resulted in a longer text than the original patch.
   (merge 407a792 jc/apply-ws-fix-expands later to maint).

 * The interactive "show a list and let the user choose from it"
   interface used by "git add -i" unnecessarily prompted the user even
   when the candidate list was empty, against which the only "choice"
   the user could have made was to choose nothing.
   (merge a9c4641 ak/add-i-empty-candidates later to maint).

 * The todo list created by "git rebase -i" did not fully honor
   core.abbrev settings.
   (merge edb72d5 ks/rebase-i-abbrev later to maint).

 * "git fetch" over a remote-helper that cannot respond to the "list"
   command could not fetch from a symbolic reference (e.g., HEAD).
   (merge 33cae54 mh/deref-symref-over-helper-transport later to maint).

 * "git push --signed" gave an incorrectly worded error message when
   the other side did not support the capability.

 * The "git push --signed" protocol extension did not limit what the
   "nonce" (a server-chosen string) could contain nor how long it
   could be, which was unnecessarily lax. Limit both the length and
   the alphabet to a reasonably small space that can still have enough
   entropy.
   (merge afcb6ee jc/push-cert later to maint).

 * The completion script (in contrib/) clobbered the shell variable $x
   in the global shell namespace.
   (merge 852ff1c ma/bash-completion-leaking-x later to maint).

 * We incorrectly formatted a "uintmax_t" integer that doesn't fit in
   "int".
   (merge d306f3d jk/decimal-width-for-uintmax later to maint).

 * The configuration parser used to be confused when reading
   configuration from a blob object that ends with a lone CR.
   (merge 1d0655c jk/config-no-ungetc-eof later to maint).

 * The pack bitmap support did not build with older versions of GCC.
   (merge bd4e882 jk/pack-bitmap later to maint).

 * The documentation wasn't clear that "remote.<nick>.pushURL" and
   "remote.<nick>.URL" are there to name the same repository accessed
   via different transports, not two separate repositories.
   (merge 697f652 jc/remote-set-url-doc later to maint).

 * Older GnuPG implementations may not correctly import the keyring
   material we prepare for the tests to use.
   (merge 1f985d6 ch/new-gpg-drops-rfc-1991 later to maint).

 * The credential helper for Windows (in contrib/) used to mishandle
   user names that contain an at-sign.
   (merge 13d261e av/wincred-with-at-in-username-fix later to maint).

 * "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) used to show byte-by-byte
   differences, which could cause multi-byte characters to be chopped
   in the middle. It learned to pay attention to character boundaries
   (assuming UTF-8).
   (merge 8d00662 jk/colors later to maint).

 * Document longstanding configuration variable naming rules in
   CodingGuidelines.
   (merge 35840a3 jc/conf-var-doc later to maint).

 * An earlier workaround to squelch unhelpful deprecation warnings
   from the compiler on OS X unnecessarily set a minimum required
   version of the OS, which the user might want to raise (or lower)
   for other reasons.
   (merge 88c03eb es/squelch-openssl-warnings-on-macosx later to maint).

 * Certain older vintages of cURL give irregular output from
   "curl-config --vernum", which confused our build system.
   (merge 3af6792 tc/curl-vernum-output-broken-in-7.11 later to maint).

 * In v2.2.0, we broke "git prune" that runs in a repository that
   borrows from an alternate object store.
   (merge b0a4264 jk/prune-mtime later to maint).

 * "git submodule add" failed to squash "path/to/././submodule" to
   "path/to/submodule".
   (merge 8196e72 ps/submodule-sanitize-path-upon-add later to maint).

 * "git merge-file" did not work correctly when invoked in a
   subdirectory.
   (merge 204a8ff ab/merge-file-prefix later to maint).

 * "git blame" could die trying to free an uninitialized piece of
   memory.
   (merge e600592 es/blame-commit-info-fix later to maint).

 * "git fast-import" used to crash when it could not close and
   finalize the resulting packfile cleanly.
   (merge 5e915f3 jk/fast-import-die-nicely-fix later to maint).

 * "update-index --refresh" used to leak memory when an entry could
   not be refreshed for whatever reason.
   (merge bc1c2ca sb/plug-leak-in-make-cache-entry later to maint).

 * The "interpolated-path" option of "git daemon" inserted any string
   the client declared on the "host=" capability request without
   checking. Sanitize and limit %H and %CH to a saner and a valid DNS
   name.
   (merge b485373 jk/daemon-interpolate later to maint).

 * "git daemon" unnecessarily looked up the hostname even when "%CH"
   and "%IP" interpolations were not requested.
   (merge dc8edc8 rs/daemon-interpolate later to maint).

 * We relied on "--no-" prefix handling in Perl's Getopt::Long
   package, even though that support didn't exist in Perl 5.8 (which
   we still support). Manually add support to help people with older
   Getopt::Long packages.
   (merge f471494 km/send-email-getopt-long-workarounds later to maint).

 * "git apply" was not very careful about reading from, remo
