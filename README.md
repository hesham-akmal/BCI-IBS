<h1>Brain-ADAS: A brain-operated Advanced Driver-Assistance System for Collision Avoidance</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.25 million deaths result from road
accidents every year. Consequently, lots of technologies have been developed in order to reduce
the accidents to save people’s lives. This project aims at developing an advanced driver-
assistance system to increase the safety of the car by preventing collisions in emergency
situations. It combines inputs from the surrounding environment with driver’s brain
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By analyzing EEG activity, emergency braking can be
initiated before the driver executes the physical action of braking. This could help in taking an
appropriate action, whether by performing a brake and/or steer maneuvers, to prevent serious
accidents. Temporal signatures in the recorded EEG that correspond to emergency braking are
extracted from the recorded EEG. Such signatures are then used to train different machine
learning algorithms that are subsequently used to decode the driver’s EEG activity to infer
his/her intention. Implemented algorithms have been examined on data recorded throughout the
project using the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset. The proposed system comprises a computer vision
component that analyzes the surrounding driving environment and augment the EEG-based
decision. The proposed system has also been tailored to operate within the AUTOSAR
framework.
